# Basic-To-Do-List

## Working Link : 


This is a really Basic implementation of a Todo List made it when I started with Web Development.
This ToDo List supports both add and delete operations. When you enter a Task inside the form and press enter it get's added to the pending List .
When you click on an item in the pending list it gets removed. 
The application has an engaging comic color scheme ans is also mobile responsive.
